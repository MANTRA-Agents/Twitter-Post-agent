One-liners only: witty, unpredictable, and sprinkled with nerd energy.

This collaboration will kick off with initial deliveries of the striking pink electric vehicles (EVs) in Dubai starting this December.\n\nEarlier this year, MANTRA selected Pyse as a key member of the MANTRA Incubator program as part of its commitment to fostering innovative solutions in the green technology sector. Pyse aims to tokenize more than 10,000 electric motorcycles on the MANTRA Chain by the end of 2025, revolutionizing last-mile delivery while contributing to environmental sustainability.\n\n\"Dubai's logistics and food delivery sector is on the brink of an electric revolution,” said Kaustubh Padakannaya, Co-founder of Pyse. “Our partnership with MANTRA allows us to tokenize the leasing of electric motorcycles, making them accessible to retail audiences. This initiative celebrates Dubai's sustainability goals while providing affordable mobility for all the rider heroes.”\n\nPyse goes beyond traditional models, enabling individuals to offset their carbon footprint and earn returns by investing directly in green assets like electric mobility and renewable energy. The MANTRA pink bike was revealed in October during Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai.\n\nMANTRA CEO & Co-Founder John Patrick Mullin commented on the partnership: \"As the demand for eco-friendly delivery solutions in the region rises, this partnership positions MANTRA Chain and Pyse at the forefront of bringing quality and purposeful RWAs onchain. The deployment of these eye-catching pink EV motorcycles marks a significant step towards achieving Dubai's ambitious sustainability goals.”\n\nThe MANTRA Incubator Program launched in June 2024. Pyse participated in the inaugural cohort alongside two projects in real estate and finance. The incubated projects received support and mentorship to build robust decentralized applications on MANTRA’s infrastructure.\n\nLearn more about the MANTRA Incubator Program by following x.com/mantra_chain and Pyse’s sustainability mission and delivery fleet rollout at x.com/PyseEarth.\n\nAbout MANTRA\n\nMANTRA is a purpose-built Layer 1 blockchain for real-world assets, capable of adherence to real-world regulatory requirements.

        "For Builders\nFor Traders\nFor Institutions\nResources\n\nAnnouncements\n\nAcademy\n\nDeveloper Guide\n\nEcosystem\n\nIncubator\n\nPartners\n\n$OM Token\n\nMANTRA Zone\nEVM Staking Update on MANTRA.finance\n\n$OM Coin\n\nDecember 24, 2024\n\nShare:\n\nAs we continue to transition and prepare for significant CEX integrations for our MANTRA Chain Mainnet OM, we are excited to announce important updates regarding EVM OM Staking on MANTRA.finance.\n\nDecember Rewards\n\nThe rewards earned in December for BSC, POL and ETH OM staking will be distributed on MANTRA Chain mainnet. Read below to find out how you can secure your allocation.\n\nStarting January 1st 2025\n\nEVM OM Staking Continues on Ethereum only:\n\n1. MANTRA will maintain EVM OM staking rewards for OM tokens on Ethereum.\n\n2. The Staking Pools on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and Polygon will be deprecated.\n\n3. Going forward, the rewards earned in the Ethereum staking pool will be distributed on the MANTRA Chain using Mainnet OM.\n\nMonthly Reward Distribution\n\nEach month, MANTRA will allocate 1 million OM tokens to EVM stakers in the Ethereum staking pool. This distribution will be done on a pro-rata basis, taking into account both the amount of tokens staked and the duration of staking. The 1 million OM will be fairly distributed among all stakers according to these criteria. Changes to the allocated staking rewards will be announced prior to the next distribution phases.\n\nDuring the month, we will capture snapshots to facilitate the allocation to your MANTRA wallet. The OM rewards will undergo daily linear vesting over the one-month period and the tokens can be claimed on MANTRA.Zone\n\nWhat Do EVM OM Stakers in the Ethereum Staking Pool Need to Do?\n\nAs an EVM OM staker on MANTRA.finance, there’s no immediate action required regarding your staked EVM OM. However, you do need to link the EVM wallet you used for staking to a MANTRA Chain address that you control. To accomplish this, please use our MANTRA Bridge to transfer a small amount of OM (as little as 1 OM) from your Ethereum wallet to your MANTRA Chain wallet. This step will confirm your custody over both wallets and enable the proper allocation of rewards on Mainnet.\n\nImportant: If you do not link your wallet in time before the next distributions, you will need to wait until the following month's distributions start. Any rewards that are unclaimed for >2 months are forfeited.\n\nWhat Do EVM OM Stakers in the BSC or Polygon staking pools Need to Do?\n\nTo secure your rewards for December 2024, you would need to bridge a small amount of OM from ETHEREUM to Mantra Chain using the same address as you are staking with on BSC or Polygon. Please do not bridge from Polygon or BSC directly as it is not supported.\n\nIn order to keep earning staking rewards in 2025, you would have to do either of the following:\n\n(1) Unstake from the BSC/POL pool and move your EVM OM to Ethereum. Then stake in the Ethereum single asset staking pool on MANTRA.finance\n\n(2) Move your tokens to Ethereum first, and then bridge them over to MANTRA Chain to enjoy Mainnet staking rewards (which will always be higher than staking rewards on EVM side)\n\nHow Are Rewards Distributed?\n\nAll reward distribution campaigns on MANTRA Chain are managed through MANTRA.zone. By connecting the correct MANTRA wallet that earned an allocation, you will be able to view your available and vesting OM amounts for each campaign, separated by staking month.\n\nWhat Should You Do with Your Mainnet OM?\n\nThe decision on how to utilize your Mainnet OM is entirely yours. You may choose to stake it at our higher mainnet staking reward rate, currently exceeding 17% per annum, or explore our Swap and Liquidity features.\n\nPlease note, that currently the UI is still reading the APR directly from the staking contract and therefore shows 0%. Rest assured that this is not the case, and our tech team will adjust this for January 2025.\n\nWe appreciate your continued support as we enhance the MANTRA ecosystem. Stay tuned for more updates, and happy staking!\n\n‍\n\nAbout MANTRA\n\nMANTRA is a purpose-built Layer 1 blockchain for real-world assets, capable of adherence to real-world regulatory requirements.

The protocol is built around singleton contracts, which makes it easier to manage and integrate with other protocols. MANTRA DEX is based on White Whale V2.\n\nThe following is the architecture of MANTRA DEX, and a general description of each contract:\n\nThe direction of the arrows represents the dependencies between the contracts.\n\nPool Manager\n\nThe Pool Manager is the contract that manages the pools in the DEX. It is responsible for creating pool and handling swaps. Pool creation is permisionless, meaning anyone can create a pool if the fee is paid. The Pool Manager depends on the Farm Manager and the Fee Collector.\n\nFarm Manager\n\nThe Farm Manager is the contract that manages the farms in the protocol. It is responsible for creating and distributing farms on pools. Farm creation is permissionless, meaning anyone can create a farm if the fee is paid. The Farm Manager depends on the Epoch Manager, as farm rewards are distributed based on epochs.\n\nFee Collector\n\nThe Fee Collector collects the fees accrued by the protocol. Whenever a pool or a farm is created, a fee is sent to the Fee Collector. As of now, the Fee Collector does not have any other function.\n\nEpoch Manager\n\nThe Epoch Manager is the contract that manages the epochs in the protocol. Its single responsibility is to be the clock of the system, which is used by the Farm Manager for distributing farm rewards.\n\nInstantiation\n\nBased on the dependencies between the contracts, the instantiation of the contracts follows the following order:\n\nEpoch Manager\n\nFee Collector\n\nFarm Manager\n\nPool Manager\n\nNote: Since there's a circular dependency between the Farm Manager and the Pool Manager, instantiate the Farm Manager by passing an empty address as the pool manager and once the contract is instantiated, invoke the UpdateConfig message with the right value (unless created with instantiate2).\n\nPrevious\nOverview\nNext\nDeployments\n\nLast updated 1 month ago\n\nThis site uses cookies to deliver its service and to analyse traffic.

Serving as the final testing ground for MANTRA Chain’s infrastructure, DuKong allows developers to experiment with various aspects of MANTRA Chain. \n\nThe testnet is mirroring mainnet behavior and ensures that developers can identify and resolve issues before live deployment. Thus DuKong Testnet enables dApp developers to test in a real-world environment, ensuring smooth mainnet deployment. Key features include the use of the OM token, account creation, token transfers, CosmWasm for smart contract development,  custom modules for RWAs, a user-friendly interface, phased validator onboarding, and community engagement through activities and incentives.\n\nDuKong comprises a distributed network of nodes using a decentralized protocol and a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism to ensure transaction accuracy and network security.\n\nIt's important to understand that the DuKong testnet operates with its own transactions and states, distinct from those of the mainnet.\n\nStatus: https://rpc.dukong.mantrachain.io/status\n\nObtain OM test tokens: http://faucet.dukong.mantrachain.io/\n\nBlock Explorer: https://explorer.mantrachain.io\n\nPrevious\nGetting Started\nNext\nInstall Prerequisites\n\nLast updated 3 months ago\n\nThis site uses cookies to deliver its service and to analyse traffic.

In traditional industries from finance to supply chain, billions were poured into the development of private blockchain-based enterprise networks to facilitate the seamless exchange of tokenized value between pre-approved intermediaries. The idea was that spinning up these advanced, albeit still closed, digital networks would somehow animate traditionally illiquid assets such as real estate, equities, debentures, commodities or art. \n\nBut closed networks remain closed. Permissioned networks have yet to reach critical mass. The evidence suggests that, in their current state, they never will. \n\nMANTRA Chain offers a permissionless environment for permissioned applications to thrive. Instead of embedding compliance at the consensus level, smart contract modules enable flexible, robust permissioning whenever and however necessary at the application layer.\n\n\n\n\nLast updated 3 months ago\n\nThis site uses cookies to deliver its service and to analyse traffic.
